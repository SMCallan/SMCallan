## About Me

Starting with the academics **Computer Science (MSc)** and **Psychology (BSc)**, I approach technical challenges using a creative aproach, that blends a deep critical analysis of the problem, and breaking down complex details and systems, into smaller digestable components. I emphasise two distinct areas, software engineering and cyber security. From an engineering perspective, as well as a practical, knowledge and skills based approach. I build websites, applications, and perform security analyses and practice ethical hacking.
